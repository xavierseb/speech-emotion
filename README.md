# speech-emotion
a neural net that inputs monotonous speech and outputs the same speech with injected emotion

The aim is to add emotion into the speech output such as Alexa, Google and Siri.
The voices are currently (April 2020) lacking in basic human emotion, ideally a voice like Alexa should be able to imitate the emotion of the voice she hears whenever this would be appropriate, such as humour, joy, frustration or sadness, the aim is to make Alexa become more easy to "connect with".
It would be nice if Alexa was able to tell a joke with a giggly voice too.

Ideas on implementation are:
- the adaptation of so-called "artistic styling", 
- the use of GAN to home in on a net that outputs convincing emotion in the voice.
- any other ideas (please add here)
